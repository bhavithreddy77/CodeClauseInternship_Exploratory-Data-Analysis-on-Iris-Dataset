#codeclauseinternship_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Iris-Dataset

Aim -
Conduct exploratory data analysis on the famous Iris dataset to understand its
characteristics and relationships between features.

Summary and Conclusion

Sepal and Petal Characteristics:
Length of petals and width of petals highly correlate with one another hence are good discriminators between species.
Mainly petal-related attributes and from most of the plots differentiate the setosa species against versicolor and virginica.

Separation of species:
Sepal features with other species can easily discriminate among them especially setosa since versicolor and virginica overlap heavily in their specifications more so the sepal.

Correlation:
The petal length and the petal width are very highly correlated. These two features alone would be enough to give a good signal for species prediction.

Conclusion

We have learned quite a lot about the Iris dataset doing this exploratory data analysis. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we could understand the distribution of individual features, visualize the relationships between features, and analyze the correlations and separability of species.
This analysis, hence, also forms a base from where we can build our machine learning model and accordingly use these findings in terms of feature selection, data preprocessing, and evaluation of the model.
